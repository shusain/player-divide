# Player Divider

The Player Divider is a fun and simple tool that helps you divide players into two teams for games. 

This tool is built using TypeScript and p5.js, a JavaScript library with a full set of drawing functionality. 

## How to Use

1. Type in player names in the input box and click "Add Player" to add the player into the disc.

2. Once all players have been added, click "Spin" to spin the disc and "Stop" to stop it. When stopped, the disc's wedges will fly off into one of two sides of the screen, dividing players into two teams.

3. You can clear the player list and start over by clicking the "Clear" button.
